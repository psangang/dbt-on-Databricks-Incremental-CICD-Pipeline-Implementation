# Configuring models
# Full documentation: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configuring-models

# In this example config, we tell dbt to build all models in the example/
# directory as views. These settings can be overridden in the individual model
# files using the `{{ config(...) }}` macro.
models:

    # Config indicated by + and applies to all files under models/example/ here we removed example and added bronze, silver & gold as we wnated to create new schemas
    bronze: # this is a model name
      +materialized: view
      schema: bronze
    silver: # we have not yet created silver
      +materialized: view
      schema: gold
    gold: # we have not yet created gold
      +materialized: view
      schema: gold
    example: 
      +materialized: view
      schema: example_schema # This will create schema in databricks and based on what are present in example model, it creates those views or tables
  
  # Here, if I specify table below with same example section then table will be created although it sees two entries for same model


seeds:
  dbt_project_param:
    mapping_or_lookup: # This is a seed name
      +schema: example_schema
    
  +schema: bronze # since, we are specifying at folder level i.e. dbt_project_param level it automatically picks up seed from seed folder

  # Note: dbt cannot create the same seed in multiple schemas at the same time with a single seed definition.
